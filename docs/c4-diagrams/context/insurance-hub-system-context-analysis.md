### Explanation of System Context and Flows

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the **Insurance Hub** system, its primary user, and its key external dependencies.

#### Actors and Systems

*   **Insurance Agent (Person)**: The main user of the system. This individual is responsible for creating insurance quotes, converting them into active policies, and managing them through the system's user interface.

*   **Insurance Hub (Software System)**: This is the core system being described. It is a comprehensive, microservices-based platform that handles all aspects of the insurance sales lifecycle. Its responsibilities include managing products, calculating prices, creating and storing policies, processing payments, and generating necessary documents.

*   **JSReport Service (External System)**: An external, third-party service that the Insurance Hub relies on for generating PDF documents. The hub sends data and a template to this service, which then returns a rendered PDF.

*   **Apache Kafka (External System)**: An event streaming platform that acts as the central message bus for asynchronous communication within the Insurance Hub. It decouples the microservices, allowing them to react to events (like a new policy being created) without being directly called.

*   **Bank Statements Storage (External System)**: Represents a file system or a similar storage mechanism from which the Insurance Hub periodically imports bank statements (in CSV format) to reconcile payments against policy accounts.

*   **Tariff Rules Storage (External System)**: A file system that stores the business rules for pricing. These rules are written in MVEL (MVFLEX Expression Language) and are loaded by the system at runtime to calculate prices for insurance offers.

*   **Document Storage (External System)**: A file system or blob storage used for the persistent storage of the final, generated PDF policy documents.

#### Flows

*   **Agent to Hub**: The `Insurance Agent` interacts with the `Insurance Hub` via its web interface over HTTPS to perform all their tasks.
*   **Hub to JSReport**: When a policy document needs to be created, the `Insurance Hub` makes a synchronous API call to the `JSReport Service`.
*   **Hub and Kafka**: The `Insurance Hub` is both a producer and consumer of events in `Apache Kafka`. It publishes events when significant business state changes occur (e.g., `PolicyCreated`), and other parts of the hub listen for these events to trigger subsequent processes.
*   **Hub from External Storage**: The `Insurance Hub` reads data from two key external storage systems:
    *   It reads pricing rules from the `Tariff Rules Storage` to perform calculations.
    *   It reads bank statements from the `Bank Statements Storage` to process payments.
*   **Hub to Document Storage**: After generating a PDF, the `Insurance Hub` writes the file to the `Document Storage` for long-term persistence and later retrieval.
