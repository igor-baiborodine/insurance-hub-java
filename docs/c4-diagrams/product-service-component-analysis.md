### Explanation of Components and Flows
1. **External Systems & Services**:
    - **Agent Portal Gateway**: The primary consumer of this service, making synchronous API calls to list products for display in the user interface.
    - **Policy Service**: An upstream service that fetches product details, such as the required questions for a policy, before initiating a price calculation.
    - **MongoDB**: Provides persistent storage for the product catalog, including all product details, covers, and associated questions.

2. **Internal Components**:
    - **Product API Controller**: A Micronaut REST controller that handles incoming HTTP requests from the gateway and other services. It's the synchronous entry point to the service for all product-related queries.
    - **Product Repository**: An interface defining the data persistence contract. It leverages Micronaut Data to provide reactive, non-blocking data access methods for querying the product catalog.
    - **Product**: The core domain model, representing an insurance product as a document. It encapsulates all data related to a product, such as its name, description, and the list of questions required to generate a price.
    - **Database Adapter**: The infrastructure-layer implementation of the repository, using the Micronaut MongoDB GORM and the reactive driver to interact with the **MongoDB** database.
