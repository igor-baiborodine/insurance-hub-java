### Explanation of Containers and Flows

This document explains the containers and data flows shown in the C4 Container Diagram for the Insurance Hub system.

#### Containers (Internal Systems)

*   **Web Vue App**: The frontend single-page application (SPA) built with Vue.js. It provides the user interface for the Insurance Agent.
*   **Agent Portal Gateway**: A Micronaut-based API Gateway that acts as the single entry point for all requests from the frontend. It routes traffic, handles authentication, and proxies WebSocket connections.
*   **Auth Service**: A dedicated service that handles user authentication. It validates credentials and issues JWTs for securing API access.
*   **Policy Service**: The core service responsible for the business logic of creating and managing insurance offers and policies. It acts as a central orchestrator for the policy creation flow.
*   **Product Service**: Manages the complete insurance product catalog, including information about available products, their coverage options, and the questions required to generate an offer.
*   **Pricing Service**: Calculates the price for an insurance product based on a set of rules (tariffs) and the data provided in an offer.
*   **Policy Search Service**: Provides a powerful search capability over all policies. It maintains a denormalized read model of policy data to enable fast and complex queries.
*   **Payment Service**: Handles all financial aspects, including managing policyholder accounts, processing payments, and reconciling bank statements.
*   **Documents Service**: Responsible for generating, storing, and providing access to policy-related documents, such as the final policy PDF.
*   **Dashboard Service**: Consumes sales data to provide analytics and visualizations. It calculates sales statistics and exposes them via an API for the frontend dashboards.
*   **Chat Service**: Enables real-time communication between agents using WebSockets.
*   **Databases**: Each core service that owns data has its own dedicated database, following the database-per-service pattern.
    *   **Policy Database (RDBMS)**: Stores offers and policies for the `Policy Service`.
    *   **Product Database (MongoDB)**: Stores the product catalog for the `Product Service`.
    *   **Payment Database (PostgreSQL)**: Stores accounts and transactions for the `Payment Service`.
    *   **Search & Analytics DB (Elasticsearch)**: A dual-purpose database that stores denormalized policy data for the `Policy Search Service` and aggregated sales data for the `Dashboard Service`.

#### External Systems & Services

*   **Insurance Agent (Person)**: The end-user of the system who interacts with the Web Vue App.
*   **Apache Kafka**: An event streaming platform used as a message broker for asynchronous, event-driven communication, which decouples the services.
*   **JSReport Service**: An external service used by the `Documents Service` to generate PDF documents from templates and data.
*   **File System / Storage**: Several services interact with externalized storage for specific file types:
    *   **Tariff Rules Storage**: Stores MVEL rule scripts used by the `Pricing Service`.
    *   **Bank Statements Storage**: Stores CSV bank statements that are imported by the `Payment Service`.
    *   **Document Storage**: Stores the generated PDF documents managed by the `Documents Service`.

#### Key Architectural Flows

1.  **Authentication Flow**:
    *   The `Insurance Agent` logs in via the `Web Vue App`.
    *   The `Gateway` forwards the credentials to the `Auth Service`.
    *   The `Auth Service` validates them and returns a JWT, which is used for all subsequent API calls.
    *   On each request, the `Gateway` communicates with the `Auth Service` to validate the token before routing the request.

2.  **Synchronous API Flow (Policy Creation)**:
    *   The `Gateway` routes a request to create an offer to the `Policy Service`.
    *   The `Policy Service` calls the `Product Service` to get product details, then calls the `Pricing Service` to get a price calculation.
    *   Once the offer is converted to a policy, the `Policy Service` saves it to its `Policy Database`.

3.  **Asynchronous Event Flow (Policy Finalized)**:
    *   When a policy is saved, the `Policy Service` publishes a `PolicyCreated` event to `Apache Kafka`.
    *   This event is consumed independently by several other services:
        *   The `Policy Search Service` indexes the new policy data in `Elasticsearch`.
        *   The `Payment Service` creates a new policy account in its `Payment Database`.
        *   The `Documents Service` generates a policy PDF using `JSReport Service`.
        *   The `Dashboard Service` processes the event and updates sales analytics in `Elasticsearch`.

4.  **Data Analytics Flow**:
    *   The agent views a dashboard in the `Web Vue App`.
    *   The request goes through the `Gateway` to the `Dashboard Service`.
    *   The `Dashboard Service` runs an aggregation query against its sales data in `Elasticsearch` and returns the results.

5.  **Real-time Chat Flow**:
    *   The `Web Vue App` establishes a WebSocket connection that is proxied through the `Gateway` to the `Chat Service`, enabling real-time messaging.
