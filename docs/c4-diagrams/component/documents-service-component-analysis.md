### Explanation of Components and Flows
1. **External Systems & Services**:
    - **Agent Portal Gateway**: The entry point for synchronous API calls, allowing users to request and download previously generated PDF documents.
    - **Policy Service**: The upstream service that publishes a `PolicyCreated` event when a new insurance policy is finalized, initiating the document generation process.
    - **Apache Kafka**: Acts as the message broker for asynchronous communication, delivering the `PolicyCreated` event from the `policy-service`.
    - **JSReport Service**: An external, third-party service responsible for the technical task of rendering HTML templates and data into a PDF file.
    - **Document Storage**: A file system or blob storage used for the persistent storage of the generated PDF policy documents.

2. **Internal Components**:
    - **Document API Controller**: A REST controller that handles incoming HTTP requests from the gateway for downloading policy documents.
    - **Policy Event Listener**: A Kafka listener (built with Kotlin) that subscribes to the `PolicyCreated` event topic. This is the starting point for the asynchronous generation flow.
    - **Document Generation Service**: The central application service that orchestrates the PDF creation process. It is triggered by the event listener and coordinates interactions with the PDF client and the document repository.
    - **PDF Generator Client**: An infrastructure client responsible for communicating with the external `JSReport Service`, sending it the necessary data and template information to render a PDF.
    - **Document Repository**: An infrastructure adapter that handles the persistence of the generated documents, saving them to and retrieving them from the **Document Storage**.
    - **Kafka Consumer**: The low-level infrastructure component that connects to Kafka, consumes the event messages, and forwards them to the `Policy Event Listener`.
